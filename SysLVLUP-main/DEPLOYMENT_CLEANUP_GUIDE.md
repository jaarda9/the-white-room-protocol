# Deployment Cleanup Guide

## Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Two different Vercel deployments showing different content:
- `https://sys-lvlup.vercel.app/` (main deployment)
- `https://sys-lvlup-git-main-jaarda9s-projects.vercel.app/` (git branch deployment)

**Root Cause**: Duplicate project structure with nested directories:
- Root level: Main project files
- Nested level: `SysLvLUp/Alarm/` with identical files

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Duplicate Directory
- Deleted the entire `SysLvLUp/` nested directory structure
- Kept only the root-level project files

### 2. Updated Vercel Configuration
Simplified `vercel.json` with proper function runtime configuration:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "functions": {
    "api/*.js": {
      "runtime": "nodejs18.x"
    }
  },
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Fixed Module System Issues
- Converted all API files from ES modules to CommonJS
- Fixed mixed `require`/`export` syntax in API files
- Updated `server.js` to reference root directory instead of nested structure

### 4. Committed and Pushed Changes
- All changes committed to `main` branch
- Pushed to GitHub to trigger new Vercel deployment

## Prevention Guidelines

### 1. Maintain Single Source of Truth
- Keep all project files at the root level
- Avoid creating nested duplicate directories
- Use proper folder organization without duplication

### 2. Vercel Deployment Best Practices
- Use consistent `vercel.json` configuration
- Deploy from the main branch for production
- Use preview deployments for testing before merging

### 3. Git Workflow
- Always commit and push changes to trigger deployments
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Review deployment logs in Vercel dashboard

## Expected Result

After this cleanup:
- Both URLs should now show identical content
- Deployments will be consistent and predictable
- No more confusion between different deployment versions

## Verification Steps

1. Check both URLs after deployment completes
2. Verify they show the same content
3. Test functionality on both deployments
4. Monitor Vercel deployment logs for any issues

## Next Steps

1. Wait for Vercel to complete the new deployment
2. Test both URLs to confirm they're identical
3. Update any bookmarks or links to use the main URL
4. Consider removing the git branch deployment if not needed
